#**Week 2 Lab Report**

## How do I log into a course-specific account on ieng6?
### Follow these steps!
### 1) Installing VS Code
I already had VS Code installed, but when I first installed it last quarter, I googled "VS Code" and clicked [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I then clicked download for Windows and followed the instructions it gave me. Here's a picture of VS code open on my computer:

### 2) Remotely Connecting
Next, you should open the terminal in VS Code. Type in `ssh cs15lsp22zzz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` into the terminal. (Replace _zzz_ with your specific username, which you can find on the [ACS Website](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)). Then, type in the password that you reset on the ACS website prior to this. It's normal for it to look like you're not actually typing anything; that's the ssh's way of password protecting! Here's what mine looked like after login:

### 3) Trying Some Commands
You can test out some commands that will help you become a more efficient programmer. One command I tested out was list files, which is `ls`. Here's a screenshot of what happened after I pressed enter: ![Image](https://imgur.com/a/G0JvaUN)
